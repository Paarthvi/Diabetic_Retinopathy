# Diabetic Retinopathy

## Dataset 
A comprehensive dataset can be found on kaggle.  
Use the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data) for the data set

## Usage
Run the playbook using python3 with the appropriate libraries installed.  
Refer to the requirements.txt file for the detailed requirements.  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
Use the `retina_weights.hdf5` for an accuracy of ~= 83.9%.
## Yet to come...
Multiple `.py` files
* One for training and generating the weights.hdf5.
* Second for testing individual image using the pre stored weights.


## Further work to be done
* Split the notebook into usable `python` files.
* Generate model summary into a file.
* Document the different analysis.
